/// A Java calendar that calculates astronomical times such as {@link #getSunrise() sunrise}, {@link #getSunset()
/// sunset} and twilight times. This class contains a {@link #getCalendar() Calendar} and can therefore use the standard
/// Calendar functionality to change dates etc... The calculation engine used to calculate the astronomical times can be
/// changed to a different implementation by implementing the abstract {@link AstronomicalCalculator} and setting it with
/// the {@link #setAstronomicalCalculator(AstronomicalCalculator)}. A number of different calculation engine
/// implementations are included in the util package.
/// <b>Note:</b> There are times when the algorithms can't calculate proper values for sunrise, sunset and twilight. This
/// is usually caused by trying to calculate times for areas either very far North or South, where sunrise / sunset never
/// happen on that date. This is common when calculating twilight with a deep dip below the horizon for locations as far
/// south of the North Pole as London, in the northern hemisphere. The sun never reaches this dip at certain times of the
/// year. When the calculations encounter this condition a null will be returned when a
/// <code>{@link java.util.Date}</code> is expected and {@link Long#MIN_VALUE} when a <code>long</code> is expected. The
/// reason that <code>Exception</code>s are not thrown in these cases is because the lack of a rise/set or twilight is
/// not an exception, but an expected condition in many parts of the world.
///
/// Here is a simple example of how to use the API to calculate sunrise.
/// First create the Calendar for the location you would like to calculate sunrise or sunset times for:
///
/// <pre>
/// String locationName = &quot;Lakewood, NJ&quot;;
/// double latitude = 40.0828; // Lakewood, NJ
/// double longitude = -74.2094; // Lakewood, NJ
/// double elevation = 20; // optional elevation correction in Meters
/// // the String parameter in getTimeZone() has to be a valid timezone listed in
/// // {@link java.util.TimeZone#getAvailableIDs()}
/// TimeZone timeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;America/New_York&quot;);
/// GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation(locationName, latitude, longitude, elevation, timeZone);
/// AstronomicalCalendar ac = new AstronomicalCalendar(location);
/// </pre>
///
/// To get the time of sunrise, first set the date you want (if not set, the date will default to today):
///
/// <pre>
/// ac.getCalendar().set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);
/// ac.getCalendar().set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 8);
/// Date sunrise = ac.getSunrise();
/// </pre>
///

   * were without an atmosphere, true sunset and sunrise would correspond to a 90&deg; zenith. Because the Sun is not
   * a point, and because the atmosphere refracts light, this 90&deg; zenith does not, in fact, correspond to true
   * sunset or sunrise, instead the center of the Sun's disk must lie just below the horizon for the upper edge to be
   * obscured. This means that a zenith of just above 90&deg; must be used. The Sun subtends an angle of 16 minutes of
   * arc (this can be changed via the {@link #setSunRadius(double)} method , and atmospheric refraction accounts for
   * 34 minutes or so (this can be changed via the {@link #setRefraction(double)} method), giving a total of 50
